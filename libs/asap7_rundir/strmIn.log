WARNING (XSTRM-75): Target library 'VirtuosoDesignLibName' is attached to the technology library 'asap7_TechLib'. Therefore, the technology file is opened in read-only mode. All the undefined layer-purpose pairs will be dropped.
INFO (XSTRM-217): Reading the layer map file, /home/aavyas1/libs/asap7/asap7PDK/cdslib/asap7_TechLib/asap7_TechLib.layermap
WARNING (XSTRM-38): The library asap7sc7p5t_24 in the refLibList file strminref.txt could not be found. This is because the library 'asap7sc7p5t_24' specified in refLibList file does not exist. Ensure that the library 'asap7sc7p5t_24' is defined in the library definition file and also exists in the location specified in the library definition file.

INFO (XSTRM-163): You have not used the '-viaMap' option. If a viaMap file, corresponding technology file or technology library exist, then use the '-viaMap' option for creating oaVia instances in the Streamed-In library. Using the '-viaMap' option improves performance and VM usage of applications using the Streamed-In design.
